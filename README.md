**HR Analytics Dashboard – Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing Human Resources data through an interactive dashboard designed to support data-driven HR decision-making. The dashboard consolidates key employee metrics and transforms raw data into clear, actionable insights.

The work included data modeling, data cleaning, and the creation of calculated metrics such as average engagement, average satisfaction, engagement percentage, satisfaction percentage, and work-life balance indicators. These metrics allow HR teams to monitor employee well-being and performance at both a high level and a detailed departmental level.

The dashboard enables dynamic filtering by termination type (voluntary, involuntary, resignation, retirement, and unknown), allowing users to analyze how different exit reasons relate to engagement, satisfaction, and work-life balance. This functionality helps identify potential retention risks and patterns linked to employee turnover.

Insights are presented by department, highlighting differences in engagement and satisfaction across areas such as Executive Office, Software Engineering, Sales, Production, IT/IS, and Administrative Offices. This comparison helps HR leaders detect departments that may require targeted interventions.

In addition, the dashboard includes time-based analysis, showing how work-life balance evolves over time. This makes it easier to identify trends, improvements, or declines related to organizational changes or HR initiatives.

Overall, this project demonstrates the use of HR analytics, interactive reporting, and visualization techniques to turn complex employee data into meaningful insights that support strategic workforce planning, performance management, and employee experience improvement.
